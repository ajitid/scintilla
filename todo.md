- Make it more resilient: If I switch normally/quickly changing brightness from integrated laptop monitor to DDC external monitor, the API fails. Haven't check if get brightness is failing or set brightness
- Also, holding custom brightness keys (golang.design/x/hotkey) doesn't continously emit the events. It batches them and then sends it. I can ask claude to give me window native global hotkey keyhook events, otherwise search for windows only lib. But first, try if I can fix the code and keep using golang.design/x/hotkey 
- Store in systray https://github.com/linexjlin/inputGPT/blob/main/go.mod#L6
- Add manifest and ico https://github.com/akavel/rsrc
- use floral pattern for logo (see screenshot taken in photos app in phone)
- see syncthing docs to see all the possible options to start the app on startup
- convert all float64 to float32 and avoid unnecessary casting
